## How to Play
1. **Starting the Game**: Open the app and navigate to the Home screen. From there, enter the Start screen where the game initiates.
2. **Playing the Game**: A virtual deck of cards will appear on the screen. The first player taps on the deck to draw a card at random.
3. **Completing Challenges**: Each card corresponds to a specific challenge which is described below in the 'Card Challenges' section. The player must perform the challenge associated with the drawn card.
4. **Continuation**: The turn passes to the next player who then draws the next card from the deck. This continues in a circular fashion among the players.

## Rules
- **Card Drawing**: Each player must tap on the deck to draw a card on their turn.
- **Challenge Execution**: Upon drawing a card, the player must perform the challenge associated with that card.
- **Passing the Turn**: After completing their challenge, the player passes the device to the next player for their turn.
- **Game End**: The game ends when all cards have been drawn from the deck.

## Card Challenges
Each card drawn from the deck initiates a specific challenge as described below:

### Numeric and Face Cards
